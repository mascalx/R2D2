Small Logic display scripts. One RPi Zero drives two TFT displays to simulate the small logic panels. Commands will be received by serial from main RPi (model 3?).

On every Rpi install python-spi to enable serial communications. On Rpi Zero install also lights.py and TFT.py

The .stl file is the modified version to hold a TFT display (you need to print 2 as for the original of course).
